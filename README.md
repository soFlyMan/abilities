**Abilities that I really need**

That's about my aims not only for now but for the future.There are a lot of contact between each part.Such as programming and Habits. I try to get into the habit of reading and coding.
And now I'm typing README in English.I will describe my thought in the same way.

I don't know how long it would need.Knowledge is infinite.I can just change a littte erery day.After all I know what kind of sitution I am in.
Even though the future is still very long,I have wasted so much time.
